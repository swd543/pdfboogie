# PDFBoogie

Private PDF tools for the browser. Every operation — compressing, merging,
converting, signing — runs entirely on your machine. Your documents are never
uploaded anywhere: there is no backend to upload to.

- **Compress PDF** — lossless re-save (custom Rust/WASM core) or a strong
  visual-quality mode that rebuilds pages as optimized images.
- **Merge PDF** — combine PDFs (and images) into one document, reorder with
  up/down controls.
- **Combine pages (n-up)** — place 2 / 4 / 6 / 9 pages per sheet, portrait or
  landscape, like a home-print 2-up layout.
- **Image → PDF** — turn PNG/JPEG/WebP images into a PDF, one image per page.
- **PDF → Image** — export pages as PNG, JPEG or WebP (any DPI), single file or
  ZIP.
- **Sign & Fill** — draw, type or upload a signature, place stamps on any page,
  and fill standard PDF form fields (text, checkbox, dropdown).
- **PDF → Word** — convert PDF text to DOCX or ODT, client-side.

Built with [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com) (SSG), pdf.js, pdf-lib,
fflate and a hand-rolled Rust/WASM core. No server-side code: the whole site is
static HTML + JS.

## Quick start

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:3000 (assets copied automatically)
```

Other scripts:

```sh
pnpm typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint         # biome check .
pnpm test         # unit tests (vitest)
pnpm build        # production build (base path via VITE_BASE, default /)
pnpm start        # serve the built site

pnpm test:fixtures   # regenerate the E2E PDF/image fixtures
pnpm test:e2e        # Playwright E2E against the production build
pnpm wasm            # rebuild the Rust/WASM core (needs wasm-pack)
pnpm og              # regenerate the Open Graph image
```

## Privacy model

All processing happens in the browser:

- PDF parsing/rendering: **pdf.js** (lazy-loaded, WASM-free worker).
- Structural edits (merge, form fill, stamps, encryption checks): **pdf-lib**.
- Lossless re-save + file probing: **pdfcore** (Rust + lopdf compiled to
  WebAssembly, ~364 KB, with a pure-JS fallback).
- ZIP creation (PDF → Image, multi-file outputs): **fflate** in JS.

No analytics, no telemetry, no cookies. See `src/site/config.ts` for the
donation wallet info shown in the footer (direct wallet addresses — no
intermediary).

## Layout

```
src/
  app.tsx            routes + shell
  document.tsx       <html> template, CSP, meta
  entry-client.tsx   browser entry (hydration)
  entry-server.tsx   SSG entry
  site/              config (brand, tools, wallets), seo, ads
  components/        Shell, DropZone, AdSlot, SignaturePad, Icons, ...
  lib/               pdfjs wrapper, pdf-lib wrapper, wasm, zip, imaging, ...
  features/          one folder per tool: pure logic + unit tests
  routes/            one file per public URL (SSG prerenders each)
wasm/pdfcore/        Rust crate (lopdf) → wasm/pdfcore/pkg/ (CI-built) → public/wasm/
e2e/                 Playwright suite, fixtures generator, helpers
scripts/             asset copy, sitemap/robots postbuild, og-image
docs/                architecture, ads, seo, deployment
```

Each tool is a route with its own lazy-loaded chunk; page bundles stay small
and the landing page prerenders to fully static HTML for search engines.
